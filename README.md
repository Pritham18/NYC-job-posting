# NYC-job-posting
This project explores the dynamics of the New York City job market using real job posting data from NYCâ€™s official website. The main objective was to understand hiring trends, job type distributions, salary ranges, and agency-wise job availability to uncover patterns that are useful for job seekers, policymakers, and researchers.
